# Simple-Fault-tolerant-Distributed-System

The flagship multi-week project involved the design and implementation of an industry-grade fault-tolerant distributed asynchronous system, with heartbeats, distributed consensus, total ordering, checkpointing, and logging to provide strong consistency for a distributed replicated application. This project involved supporting different replication styles (active, or hot-swap replication, as well as passive, or primary-backup replication), along with mechanisms to ensure no downtime even as crash faults are injected.
